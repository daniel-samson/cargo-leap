Leap passed the setup for your project and craft applications quickly with ease. Cargo leap is a cargo subcommand for generating new projects from examples.

Project Goals:
- Provide a means to create project template
- Provide a Leap.toml file that can be added to the root of any rust project
- Download any crate from crates.io and read the Leap.toml
- Generate the init project from Leap.toml

Current Status: Just parking name on crates.io will have something working very soon
